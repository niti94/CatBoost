Hacker earth challenge
We are living in a digital world where people prefer to read articles online or watch videos rather than reading a book. Assume that you are a member of a marketing agency and you are given a dataset having the title, subjects, and other features based on which you have to predict what will be the material of to-be-published research so that you can tie-up with an ideal publisher and help them grow. The following are the material types:

Book

Sound disc

Videocassette

Sound cassette

Music

Mixed

CR

Task: You have to predict the column “MaterialType” and submit in the format given in the “sample_submissions.csv” file. Also, note that evaluation criteria will be the weighted f1-score.
